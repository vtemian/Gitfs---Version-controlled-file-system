\begin{abstract}
Gitfs is a version controlled file system. Its purpose is to help non-technical users in creating versioned content without having any knowledge about version control systems. 

By using this system, any user can bring changes to the content of their project, or alter it in any way, and Gitfs will automatically version and share these modifications among all project collaborators. More so, it also shows a history of the content, by simulating snapshots for each and every change.
