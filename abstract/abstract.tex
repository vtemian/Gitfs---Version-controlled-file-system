\begin{abstract}

Gitfs is a FUSE file system that fully integrates with git. You can mount a branch of a remote repository locally and any subsequent changes made to the files will be automatically committed to the remote.

Gitfs was designed to bring the full powers of git to everyone, irregardless of their experience using the tool. You can mount any repository, and all the changes you make will be automatically converted into commits. Gitfs will also expose the history of the branch youâ€™re currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.
