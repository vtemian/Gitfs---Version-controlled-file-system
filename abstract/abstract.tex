\begin{abstract}
Gitfs is a version controlled file system. Its purpose is to help non-technical users in creating versioned content without having any knowledge about version control systems. 

By using this file system, any user can bring changes to the content of their project, or alter it in any way, and Gitfs will automatically version and share these modifications among all project collaborators, solving any conflicts that emerge. More so, it also shows a history of the content, by simulating snapshots for each and every change.

Gitfs implements a transparent concurrency models and manipulates the content directly, without using another layer. In this way, the user's change will be versioned in without to notice about it. Beside that, using a multi-layered cache system, Gitfs will not add any performance overhead for the final user.
